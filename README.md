This GitHub currently does not include the code I used to set up all the data preparation and augmentation, as this
code actually includes automatically downloading and unpacking all datasets I used. Some of these datasets have their
own licenses, which I do not want to breach. In addition to this, the code used for training is used at my company, and
therefore I cannot make it public. Feel free to message me and I will give you pointers on how I did it.
